Unbiased_LambdaMart An implementation of Unbiased LambdaMart based on LightGBM (https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM). Note that LightGBM contains a wide variety of applications using gradient boosting decision tree algorithms. Our modification is mainly on the src/objective/rank_objective.hpp, which is the LambdaMart Ranking objective file.
